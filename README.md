# OpenTelemetry in Action: Understanding the Architecture of a Polyglot Application

This repository is based on the **Linux Foundation's LFS148** course, demonstrating how to implement **OpenTelemetry** in a polyglot microservices application. The original project has been extended and adapted to suit my personal use case, integrating **Spring Boot**, **Flask**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker** to showcase the power of observability through OpenTelemetry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview

The application is a ToDo list system built with a polyglot architecture using a mix of technologies, instrumented with OpenTelemetry to provide end-to-end observability.

### Core Components

1. **REST Server (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)**
   - A Spring Boot-based RESTful service interacts with a PostgreSQL database to manage the ToDo list, performing CRUD operations.

2. **Frontend (Thymeleaf + Spring Boot)**
   - The Thymeleaf frontend is implemented in Java, rendering views dynamically and interacting with the Spring Boot backend to display the ToDo tasks.

3. **Alternative Frontend (Flask + Python)**
   - This component is an alternative frontend using Flask, demonstrating how Python-based services can interact with the same backend.

4. **Load Generator**
   - A load generator simulates high-traffic scenarios by repeatedly interacting with the frontends, providing insights into system performance under load.

5. **Database (PostgreSQL)**
   - PostgreSQL serves as the data store for all ToDo list data, accessed by the backend and frontend components.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ioclabs/opentelemetry-in-action-polyglot-app.git
cd opentelemetry-in-action-polyglot-app
```

2. Set Up with Docker Compose
Use Docker Compose to set up the application stack, which includes the backend, frontends, OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, and Prometheus:

```
docker compose up --build
Once the services are running, you can access:
```

Jaeger UI: http://localhost:16686

Prometheus UI: http://localhost:9090

Flask Frontend: http://localhost:5001

Thymeleaf Frontend: http://localhost:8090

3. Interact with the Application

Both the Flask and Thymeleaf frontends allow you to interact with the ToDo list:

Add, mark as done, and delete tasks.

Observe the "Sample" item, which is automatically created and removed by the load generator.

4. Monitoring with Jaeger and Prometheus

Jaeger: Use Jaeger for distributed tracing, allowing you to visualize service interactions and identify bottlenecks.

Prometheus: Monitor key metrics, such as JVM thread count and memory usage, to keep track of system performance.
